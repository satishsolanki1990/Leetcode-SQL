--Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all
--the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.


--# Write your MySQL query statement below
select p.project_id, round(avg(e.experience_years),2) as average_years
from project p
join employee e
on p.employee_id = e.employee_id
group by p.project_id

-- other solutions [this is faster than above]
SELECT A.project_id, round(avg(A.experience_years), 2) as average_years FROM
(SELECT p.project_id, p.employee_id, e.experience_years
 FROM Project p
 INNER JOIN Employee e
 ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id) as A
GROUP BY A.project_id
